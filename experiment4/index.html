				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>My first attempt at this experiment was to try and understand how the video capturing worked. I took examples from my section as well as the slides and found that using p5.js made it really simple to capture real-time videos.
				</p>
				<p>Code: var capture;
					function setup() {
					  createCanvas(640, 480);
					  capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
					  capture.size(640,480);
					  imgCache = createGraphics(640,480)
					  imgCache.translate(640,0)
					  imgCache.scale(-1,1)
					  capture.hide();
					 
					}
				   
					function draw() {
					  background(220);
					  imgCache.image(capture,0,0)
					}
				</p>
				<p>I then began this experiment by copying one of the examples from class, specifically the example by Che-Yu Wu. I found the code very interesting because it took a video from the camera, and replaced each pixel with Chinese characters. 
				</p>
				<p>var capture;
					var radius = 20;
					var imgCache
						let overAllTexture
					function setup() {
						createCanvas(640,480);
						capture = createCapture(VIDEO);
						capture.size(640,480);
						imgCache = createGraphics(640,480)
						imgCache.translate(640,0)
						imgCache.scale(-1,1)
						// println(capture.height,capture.height)
						// background(100);
						rectMode(CENTER)
						capture.hide()
					   
					   
						overAllTexture=createGraphics(width,height)
						overAllTexture.loadPixels()
						// noStroke()
						for(var i=0;i<width+50;i++){
							for(var o=0;o<height+50;o++){
								overAllTexture.set(i,o,color(100,noise(i/3,o/3,i*o/50)*random([0,50,100])))
							}
						}
						overAllTexture.updatePixels()
					   
					}
					let mode = 1
					function draw() {
						// loadImage(capture)
						background(0);
						imgCache.image(capture,0,0)
					   
						push()
							noStroke()
							scale(1)
							radius = max(mouseX,0)/10+20
							for(var y=0;y<imgCache.height;y+=radius){
								for(var x=0;x<imgCache.width;x+=radius){
									var pixel = imgCache.get(x,y)
									var r = pixel[0]
									var g = pixel[1]
									var b = pixel[2]
					
					
									let bk = (r+g+b)/3
									let bkI = 10-int(bk/25.5)
								   
									if (mode==1){
										let txt = "一二三天四五田電龍龕龘"
										fill(r+50,g+50,b+50)
										textSize(radius)
										textStyle(BOLD)
										text(txt[bkI],x,y)
									}else if (mode==2){
										ellipse(x,y,radius/3+b/15,radius/3+b/15)
									}else if (mode==3){
										push()
											translate(x,y)
											rotate(b/20)
											colorMode(HSB)
											fill(r,100,100)
											// strokeWeight(3)
											// noFill()
											rect(0,0,radius/2.5+r/20,radius/2.5+r/20)
											fill(0)
											ellipse(0,0,5)
										pop()
									}
									// fill(0)
									// rect(x,y,radius/10+b/10-10,radius/10+b/10-20)

							image(overAllTexture,0,0)
						pop()
					   
					   
						// ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 20, 20);
					}
					
					
					function keyPressed(){
						if (key=="1"){
							mode=1
						}
						if (key=="2"){
							mode = 2
						}

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After messing around with Che-Yu’s example, I found some things that I wanted to change. One of my biggest gripes was that the ratios of the video would change with the movement of the mouse. It wasn’t the biggest deal, but it also felt needless so I decided to take it out. Another thing I messed around with was changing what characters are used for the pixels. What I found was that thin and small characters weren’t very good because it left a long empty space and the formed image looked more abstract. I then tried using ellipses instead of text for the pixels.
				</p>
				<p>Code: for(var y=0;y<imgCache.height;y+=radius){
					for(var x=0;x<imgCache.width;x+=radius){
						var pixel = imgCache.get(x,y)
						var r = pixel[0]
						var g = pixel[1]
						var b = pixel[2]
			
			
						let bk = (r+g+b)/3
						let bkI = 10-int(bk/25.5)
						let txt = "こんにちは十の言葉/"
						fill(r+50,g+50,b+50)
						textSize(radius)
						textStyle(BOLD)
						//text(txt[bkI],x,y)
					  ellipse(x,y,radius/3+b/15,radius/3+b/15)

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After understanding how the pixelization worked, I wanted to add back interactivity as well as images. So my idea was to have a second mode, activated by a mouse click which would lead to another canvas involving images. I wanted to put these images through the same video filter so I began by trying it with a Cat.png. 
				</p>
				<p>imgCache.image(img,width/2,height/2);
				</p>
				<p>After I got the cat picture working through the filter, my next step was to add a way to interact with the cat. My idea for this was to have the cat move in conjunction with the mouse, similar to the feature that I had removed earlier, but instead of zooming in on the cat it would move it around. After getting the cat on screen, I realized that I could achieve an effect where it looked like the cat could be chased or chasing something using mouse movement. So I added an additional dog picture into my experiment and adjusted its speed so that both didn’t move at the same speeds.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had another struggle with creativity this time due to not quite understanding how the images and videos worked. I had no idea how to implement the ideas that I might have had or I struggled to come up with an idea outright. This problem got significantly better when I decided to go into the examples and replicate them for myself. After understanding a little more about videos and images, I started coming up with simple ideas. I added these simple ideas together to create something that I hoped would look more complex. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about how the videos worked, especially when I actually got things working. My biggest struggle was figuring out what to do after I learned the basics of videos and images. What made it harder was the lack of direction in the assignment so I had to determine what was considered high effort.</p>
