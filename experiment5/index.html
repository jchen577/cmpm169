			<h1>Experiment 5 - 3D Graphics</h1>

				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this experiment by testing out things that were given on Professor Wes’s slides. I began by testing out the 3d feature given on p5.js starting with its most basic shapes.</p>
				<p>After some testing, I saw the torus shape/function and was very interested in what it could be. When I implemented the shape into p5.js, I realized that it resembled a donut. So I found that funny and decided to use it as the base for this experiment.
				</p>
				<p>Code: let angle = 0;
					function setup() {
					  createCanvas(400, 400,WEBGL);
					}
					
					
					function draw() {
					  background(220);
					  fill(120,100,0);
					  rotateX(angle);
					  rotateY(angle);
					  torus(200,100);
					  angle += 0.003;
					}
					</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>So I began adding onto the donut with whatever came to mind. One of the first experiments that stuck was to create a pink frosted layer of the donut, inspired by the Youtube channel Smosh. 
				</p>
				<p>I was then inspired by a memory I had of my friend taking blender tutorials to make 3d models. In the tutorial I recalled them creating a donut as well as it being on a table. So I decided to try and put the donut that I had created on a table using the box() function. The most difficult part about this was making the legs for the table because the x and y values varied depending on the browser vs putting it on VScode.
				</p>
				<p>Code: let angle = 0;
					function setup() {
					  createCanvas(1000, 2000,WEBGL);
					}
					
					function draw() {
					  background(220);
					  fill(140,100,0);
					  //rotateX(angle);
					  //rotateY(angle);
					  rotateX(45);
					  push()
					  torus(200,100);
					  translate(0,0,100);
					  fill(255,192,203)
					  torus(200,75)
					  translate(-100,500,0);
					  rotateX(30);
					  fill(255,0,0);
					  cylinder(30,100);
					  pop()
					  
					  translate(0,0,-200);
					  
					  push()
					  translate(-280,600,0);
					  rotateX(30);
					  box(50,300,10);
					  pop()
					  
					  push()
					  translate(280,600,0);
					  rotateX(30);
					  box(50,300,10);
					  pop()
					   
					  box(700,900,10);
					  angle += 0.005;
					}
					</p>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After I had set up the table and its food, I realized that if you were to look at what I had generated at a different angle, the whole thing would fall apart. I had created an illusion of the donut, table, coke bottle, and legs all being together, but in reality they were far apart. So to show that I decided to make the screen rotate when the mouse was pressed, it would rotate the screen and break the illusion. Originally, I had also intended to do a scroll wheel feature to edit the levels of zoom to allow for more changes in perspective, but then the user had no way to scroll down to the experiment without breaking the illusion.

				<p>Code: let angle = 0;
					let pressed = false;
					
					
					// draw() function is called repeatedly, it's the main animation loop
					function draw() {
						background(220);
					
					
						fill(140,100,0);
						//rotateX(angle);
						//rotateY(angle);
						rotateY(angle);
						rotateZ(angle);
						rotateX(angle);
						if(pressed){
							angle += 0.005;
						}
						rotateX(45);
						push()
						torus(200,100);
						translate(0,0,100);
						fill(255,192,203)
						torus(200,75)
						translate(-150,500,0);
						rotateX(30);
						fill(255,0,0);
						cylinder(30,100);
						translate(200,40,0);
						fill(255,255,255);
						ellipsoid(100,40,20);

						// code to run when mouse is pressed

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I really enjoyed this experiment because I managed to create something that was ‘cool’. In this case it was the fact that I had created a sort of optical illusion where it looks like I had created a table with foods and objects on it. The reality is that the table and its objects were not touching at all. My favorite part of this experiment was discovering how to create 3 objects in p5.js and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the possibilities. My least enjoyable part was how I felt that what I had done for the assignment might potentially be seen as not enough work but I personally feel like this is plenty. I still feel like I only have a beginner’s level of understanding in terms of 3d capabilities in p5.js, but it's enough for me to be satisfied with this project.
