				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off my experiment by asking chatGPT for code that would generate a trail of squares following the user’s mouse. The reason I chose this was because it was a cool particle effect that often appears in games as an aesthetic choice, and it also allowed me to complete the interactivity part of this assignment. The initial code that ChatGPT gave me worked, but there were a bunch of little things like color and trail length that I felt could be adjusted.
				</p>
				<p>The code to print a square trail is: 
					function draw() {
					background(255);
				
				  // Update the trail array with the current mouse location
				  trail.push({ x: mouseX, y: mouseY });
				
				  // Draw squares from the trail
				  for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
					let alpha = map(i, 0, trail.length, 255, 0);
					fill(0, 150, 200, alpha);
					noStroke();
					rectMode(CENTER);
					rect(trail[i].x, trail[i].y, 20, 20);
				  }
				
				  // Limit the number of points in the trail array
				  if (trail.length > 50) {
					trail.splice(0, 1);
				  }
				}</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>One thing that I changed was the color of the squares because I felt that the blue trail was bland. Another change that I made was making the squares shrink faster, allowing for the visual effect to be smoother than before.
				</p>
				<p>let trail = [];

					function setup() {
					  createCanvas(400, 400);
					}
					
					function draw() {
					  background(255);
					
					  // Update the trail array with the current mouse location
					  trail.push({ x: mouseX, y: mouseY, size: 20 });
					
					  // Draw squares from the trail
					  for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
						let alpha = map(i, 0, trail.length, 255, 0);
						fill(0, 150, 200, alpha);
						noStroke();
						rectMode(CENTER);
						rect(trail[i].x, trail[i].y, trail[i].size, trail[i].size);
					
						// Shrink the size of each square
						trail[i].size *= 0.95;
					  }
					
					  // Remove squares that have shrunk too much
					  trail = trail.filter(square => square.size > 1);
					}
					</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After changing the trail to be more visually appealing, I realized that the rest of the canvas was still blank, something that wasn’t common in the examples. One thing that I decided to add to spice up the canvas was to put the disappearing particles all over the screen. The goal of this was to use the existing trail code to make another function to try and make something fun. 
				</p>
				<p>function draw() {
					background(255);
				
				
				  // Update the trail array with a new particle
				  trail.push({ x: random(width), y: random(height), size: random(20,50) });
				  trail2.push({ x: mouseX, y: mouseY, size: squareSize });
				
				
				  // Draw squares from the trail
				  for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
					let alpha = map(i, 0, trail.length, 255, 0);
					fill(random(255), random(255), random(255), alpha);
					noStroke();
					rectMode(CENTER);
					rect(trail[i].x, trail[i].y, trail[i].size, trail[i].size);
				
				
					// Shrink the size of each square
					trail[i].size *= 0.97;
				  }
				  for (let i = 0; i < trail2.length; i++) {
					let alpha = map(i, 0, trail2.length, 255, 0);
					fill(random(255), random(255), random(255), alpha);
					noStroke();
					rectMode(CENTER);
					rect(trail2[i].x, trail2[i].y, trail2[i].size, trail2[i].size);
				
				
					// Shrink the size of each square
					trail2[i].size *= 0.97;
				  }
				
				
				  // Remove squares that have shrunk too much
				  trail = trail.filter(square => square.size > 1);
				  trail2 = trail2.filter(square => square.size > 1);
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think the lowest point of the assignment was choosing where to start. I originally did not intend to use chatGPT as a base, but I struggled to think of anything that I could do in p5.js with my current experience. So after a lot of inner struggle, I ended up using chatGPT after the professor showed examples of how to use it in class. The highest point of the assignment was the moments after I started using chatGPT. I think the reason behind this was because I could unleash the creativity in my brain without worrying about whether I could implement it or not. The end result of this assignment was satisfactory to me personally because I felt like I learned a lot about how to use p5.js, and I managed to put what was in my mind onto the screen.
