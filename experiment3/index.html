				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started off this experiment by copying an example from professor Wes’s class slides. It introduced the effects of noise one-dimensionally, but I noticed that the example would never restart, causing the affected area to become just white. 
				</p>
				<p>Version 1 Code :
					let xoff = 0;
    let yoff = 0;


    function setup() {
    createCanvas(800, 500);
    background(0);
    }


    function draw() {
    stroke(255);
    noFill();
    beginShape();
    let xoff = 0;
    for (let x = 0; x <= width; x += 10) {
        let y = map(noise(xoff, yoff), 0, 1, 0, height);
        vertex(x, y);
        xoff += 0.01;
    }
    yoff += 0.01;
    endShape();
    }
				</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After copying the professor’s code, I wanted to make it so that the generated art wouldn’t stay on the canvas forever. To do this, I integrated something that I used for experiment 2 which was using an array to store the vertices of the function before drawing it out. Using this strategy I could reset the canvas and redraw the new vertices everytime while discarding the old ones. 
				</p>
				<p>Version 2 Code: background(0);
					stroke(255);
					noFill();
					beginShape();
					for (let x1 = 0; x1 <= width; x1 += 10) {
					  let y1 = map(noise(xoff, yoff), 0, 1, 0, height);
					  trail.push({ x: x1, y: y1 });
					  //vertex(x1, y1);
					  xoff += 0.01;
					}
					yoff += 0.5;
				   
					for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
					  //let alpha = map(i, 0, trail.length, 255, 0);
					  //fill(0, 150, 200, alpha);
					  vertex(trail[i].x,trail[i].y);
					}
				   
					while(trail.length > 5000){
					  trail.shift();
					}
					endShape();
				  }
				  </p>
				  <p>After some more experimenting I managed to fix the line problem by resetting the xoff every iteration.
				</p>
				</p>Version 3 Code: background(0);
				stroke(255);
				noFill();
				let xoff = 0;
				for (let x1 = 0; x1 <= width; x1 += 10) {
				  let y1 = map(noise(xoff, yoff), 0, 1, 0, height);
				  trail.push({ x: x1, y: y1 });
				  //vertex(x1, y1);
				  xoff += 0.01;
				}
				yoff += 0.01;
			   
				for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
				  if(trail[i].x== 0){
					beginShape();
				  }
				  vertex(trail[i].x,trail[i].y);
				  if(trail[i].x == 800){
					endShape();
				  }
				}
			   
				while(trail.length > 4800){
				  trail.shift();
				}

				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>After making the noise example fade I realized that the movement resembled the waves of an ocean. That is what gave me the inspiration for the visuals of my final product. I began by making the background and the noise lines blue, but the still blue background made it hard to see it as an ocean. 
				</p>
				<p>I realized that what I needed was a way to oscillate the blue background up and down to represent the movement of the waves. So my next step was brainstorming how to implement something like that. My first idea was to look for a way to separate the backgrounds in half so that I could use the background() function for colors. I didn’t end up finding anything but I realized that I could use a rectangle that changes sizes to make it look like it was moving. 
				</p>
				<p>The wave had a semi-satisfactory effect, but it left the top half of the screen too empty. My solution to this problem was to add clouds. I asked chatGPT an easy way to make clouds in p5.js, and I implemented those scroll and wrap around the screen
				</p>
				<p>Final Product Code:  let yoff = 0;
					let trail = [];
					let cloudPos = 0;
					
					
					// draw() function is called repeatedly, it's the main animation loop
					function draw() {
					let maxY = 0;
					  background(135,206,235);
					  push();
					  if(cloudPos > 750){
						cloudPos = -550;
					  }
					  translate(cloudPos+5,0);
					  cloudPos+=5;
					  drawCloud(50,100);
					  drawCloud(200, 200);
					  drawCloud(350, 150);
					  pop();
					  stroke(0,0,255);
					  noFill();
					  let xoff = 0;
					  for (let x1 = 0; x1 <= width; x1 += 10) {
						let y1 = map(noise(xoff, yoff), 0, 1, 0, height);
						trail.push({ x: x1, y: y1 });
						//vertex(x1, y1);
						xoff += 0.01;
					  }
					  yoff += 0.01;
					 
					  for (let i = 0; i < trail.length; i++) {
						if(trail[i].x== 0){
						  beginShape();
						}
						if(trail[i].y > maxY){
						  maxY = trail[i].y;
						}
						//let alpha = map(i, 0, trail.length, 255, 0);
						//fill(0, 150, 200, alpha);
						vertex(trail[i].x,trail[i].y);
						if(trail[i].x == 800){
						  endShape();
						}
					  }
					 
					  while(trail.length > 4800){
						trail.shift();
					  }
					 
					  fill(0,0,255);
					  rect(0, maxY, width, height-maxY);
					
					
					}
					
					
					function drawCloud(x, y) {
						noStroke();
						fill(255);
					 
						// Main cloud body
						ellipse(x, y, 60, 60);
						ellipse(x + 25, y - 15, 50, 50);
						ellipse(x - 25, y - 15, 40, 40);
					  }
