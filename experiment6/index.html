			<h1>Experiment 6 - Text and Grammar</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started this experiment by taking one of the text examples from the class slides. The program took the user input and put it onto the screen.</p>
				<p>One of the problems that I had with this example was that the mouse tracking made the program quite laggy. So my first step was to remove the mouse tracking feature and figure out what to add from there.I then decided to make the text start a new line once the characters began to go off the screen.

				<p>Code:	    'use strict';


					var letters = [];
					var density = 2.5;
					var ribbonWidth = 92;
					var shapeColor;
					var fontSize = 100;
					var pathSimplification = 0;
					var pathSampleFactor = 0.1;
				   
					var textTyped = 'hi';
				   
					var font;
				   
					function preload() {
					  font = loadFont('data/PlayfulTime.ttf');
					}
				   
					function setup() {
					  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
					  noFill();
					  strokeWeight(1);
					  shapeColor = color(0);
				   
					  createLetters();
					}
				   
					function draw() {
					  background(255);
				   
					  translate(100, height*.25);
				   
					  pathSampleFactor = 0.1 * pow(0.02, mouseX / width);
					  ribbonWidth = 10;
				   
					  for (var i = 0; i < letters.length; i++) {
						letters[i].draw();
					  }
					}
				   
					function createLetters() {
					  letters = [];
					  var chars = textTyped.split('');
				   
					  var x = 0;
					  var y = 0;
					  var subbed = 0;
					  for (var i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
						if (i > 0) {
						  var charsBefore = textTyped.substring(subbed, i);
						  x = font.textBounds(charsBefore, 0, 0, fontSize).w +20;
						  if(x + fontSize > windowWidth){
							x= 0;
							subbed = i;
							y+= fontSize;
						  }
						}
						var newLetter = new Letter(chars[i], x, y);
						letters.push(newLetter);
					  }
					}
				   
					function Letter(char, x, y) {
					  this.char = char;
					  this.x = x;
					  this.y = y;
				   
					  Letter.prototype.draw = function() {
						var path = font.textToPoints(this.char, this.x, this.y, fontSize, {sampleFactor: pathSampleFactor});
						stroke(shapeColor);
				   
						for (var d = 0; d < ribbonWidth; d += density) {
						  beginShape();
				   
						  for (var i = 0; i < path.length; i++) {
							var pos = path[i];
							var nextPos = path[i + 1];
				   
							if (nextPos) {
							  var p0 = createVector(pos.x, pos.y);
							  var p1 = createVector(nextPos.x, nextPos.y);
							  var v = p5.Vector.sub(p1, p0);
							  v.normalize();
							  v.rotate(HALF_PI);
							  v.mult(d);
							  var pneu = p5.Vector.add(p0, v);
							  curveVertex(pneu.x, pneu.y);
							}
						  }
				   
						  endShape(CLOSE);
						}
					  };
					}
				   
					function keyReleased() {
					  if (keyCode == CONTROL) saveCanvas(gd.timestamp(), 'png');
				   
					  if (keyCode == LEFT_ARROW) density *= 1.25;
					  if (keyCode == RIGHT_ARROW) density /= 1.25;

				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>My first change in terms of creativity was to randomize the color of the letters.</p>
				<p>At this point I wanted to make the experiment into more of a text writer now and I felt that randomizing the colors made it look more sylistic</p>
				<p>Code:	stroke(random(0,255),random(0,255),random(0,255));
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>My first creative addition to this assignment was drawing a circle if the user had typed circle in any part of the letters. I then continued to do that for multiple other shapes such as square and triangle.</p>
				<p>Once I realized that I could have the program do certain actions, so I wanted to add a weird trippy element by having the program rotate. I realized that this would be a really nice feature to implement easter eggs into games in the future.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment was tough because I went into the assignment knowing almost nothing about how to use text and grammar. I had missed the 1st class of the week due to bus issues and that led to me not quite understanding what to do. It wasnâ€™t that difficult to catch up however and I had fun looking at many of the text examples that the professor showed in class. I took one of the examples and used it for this experiment because I thought that the program could be more intuitive. The original program was very laggy because of the density and ribbon width. The easiest part of this experiment was definitely making the text rainbow because all it required was stroke() command.
